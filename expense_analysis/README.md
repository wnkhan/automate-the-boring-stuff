# Expense Analysis Project
The expense_analysis directory contains a project that demonstrates how to ingest bank transaction data and generate an Excel workbook with monthly expense and income information.

# Dependencies
This project uses the pandas and openpyxl Python packages, which can be installed using pip:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Assumptions
It is assumed that your bank transaction data is stored in one or more CSV files named `bk_download.csv` or `bk_download(#).csv` (where `#` is a number) located in the `Downloads` folder. The script will look for these files in the following locations based on your operating system:
- Windows: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Downloads\bk_download.csv`
- macOS: `/Users/<YourUsername>/Downloads/bk_download.csv`
- Linux: `/home/<YourUsername>/Downloads/bk_download.csv`

# Usage
1. Generating Excel Workbook
Once you have your bank transactions data, you can generate an Excel workbook containing monthly expense and income information using the main.py script.

To generate the Excel workbook, navigate to the expense_analysis directory and run the following command:

```shell
python main.py
```

This will generate an Excel workbook containing monthly expense and income information, which will be saved to a default output file named `bk_download.xlsx` in the same directory.

# Notes
This project is intended as a starting point for building your own expense analysis tool. You may need to modify the code to fit your specific use case.
The output file generated by main.py will be named `bk_download.xlsx` and will be in Excel format.
The database schema and queries used in this project are intended as examples and may need to be modified to fit your specific use case.
